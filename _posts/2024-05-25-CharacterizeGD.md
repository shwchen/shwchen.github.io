slug: "characterize-graph-datasets"
description: "Homophily describes the tendency for similar nodes to connect, while heterophily involves dissimilar nodes, challenging GNNs. Current homophily measures have drawbacks. This work introduces 'adjusted homophily', which meets more desirable properties, and proposes 'label informativeness' (LI) to better distinguish heterophily types. LI aligns well with GNN performance, proving useful for characterizing graph structure."

# Introduction

## Preliminary

### Homophily
>Edges tend to connect *similar* nodes. For instance, users in social networks tend to connect to users with similar interests, and papers in citation networks mostly cite works from the same research area.

Some popular Homophily Measures: 

#### Edge Homophily

Computes the fraction of edges that connect nodes of the same class. 

$$
  h_{edge} = \frac{|\{\{u, v\} \in E: y_u = y_v\}|}{|E|}
$$

#### Node Homophily

Computes the fraction of neighbors of same class for all nodes.

$$
  h_{node} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{v\in V}\frac{|\{\{u, v\} \in N(v): y_u = y_v\}|}{d(v)}
$$

#### Class Homophily

Measures excess homophily compared to a null model where edges are independent of the labels.

$$
h_{class} = \frac{1}{C-1}\sum_{k=1}^{C}\left[ \frac{\sum_{v:y_v=k}|\{u\in N(v):y_u=y_v\}|}{\sum_{v:y_v=k}d(v)} - \frac{n_k}{n} \right]_{+}
$$

1 and 2 are sensitive to number of classes and their balance. 3 addresses the issue but only consider positive deviation from $$\frac{n_k}{n}$$ (neglecting heterophilous patterns) and does not consider variation of node degrees.

### Heterophily

>Edges tend to connect *dissimilar* nodes. For instance, in social networks, fraudsters rarely connect to other fraudsters, while in dating networks, edges often connect the opposite genders.

### Desired Properties for Homophily Measures

Given a homophily measure $$h$$:

#### Maximal Agreement (Max)

It satisfies *maximal agreement* if for any graph $$G$$ where all edges connect nodes of the same class, then $$h(G)$$ should return the max score, and a score less than max score otherwise.

#### Minimal Agreement (Min)

The opposite of Maximal Agreement.

#### Asymptotic Constant Baseline (ACB)

For large graphs generated by the configuration model, the measure consistently approximates a fixed value with high probability, ensuring reliable comparisons across datasets.

#### Empty Class Tolerance (ECT)

It is *Empty Class Tolerant* if it is defined and it does not change when we introduce an additional dummy label that is not present in the data.

#### Monotonicity (Mono)

It is *monotone* if it is empty class tolerant, increases when we add an edge between two nodes of the same class (except for perfectly homophilous graphs) and decreases when we add an edge between two nodes of different classes (except for perfectly heterophilous graphs).


## Motivation

| Measures | Max | Min | ACB | ECT | Mono |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Edge | yes | yes | no | yes | yes|
| Node | yes | yes | no | yes | no |
| Class | yes | no | no | no | no |
| Adjusted | yes | no | yes | yes | no |

Several Homophily Measures used prevalently do not satisfy the desired properties we just discussed. The authors claim that `Adjusted Homophily is a better choice as it meets most of the requirements.`{:.yelhglt}

Heterophilous graph datasets can have various connectivity patterns and some of them are easier for GNNs than others. `The authors proposed a new graph property, named Label Informativeness (LI), which characterizes how much information the neighbor's label provides about the node's label, to complement Adjusted Homophily by distinguishing different homophilous patterns.`{:.yelhglt} Empirical evidence testifies that LI better explains GNNs' performance than Homophily Measures.
